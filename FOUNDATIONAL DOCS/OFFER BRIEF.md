Level of Consciousness & Awareness
●
●
●
Level of Consciousness: High. Prospects are already aware of the "Kid Chaos" or
"Hidden Dust" in their vehicles and are actively seeking a solution to maintain their
"Sanctuary"
.
Level of Awareness: Solution/Product Aware. They know handheld vacuums exist
but are skeptical due to previous experiences with "e-waste" or "toys" that fail to pick up
sand or hair.
Stage of Sophistication: Level 3 moving to Level 4. The market is saturated with
"convenience" claims. This offer succeeds by introducing a Unique Mechanism
(Sealed-Gasket Filtration) to solve the "Dust Blowback" problem that competitors ignore.
The Big Idea
The "60-Second Car Reset": Shifting the conversation from a "cleaning chore" to a "health and
sanity benefit"
. It isn't just a vacuum; it’s a professional-grade "Air Management" tool that
purifies your micro-environment by capturing the "invisible enemy" (pollen, mites, $PM
_{2.5}$)
while providing the utility of a "Swiss Army Knife"
.
Metaphor
●
●
The "Swiss Army Knife" of air management.
A "Reverse Hair Dryer" (for the blower function).
Unique Mechanisms
●
●
Potential UMP (Unique Mechanism of the Problem): The "PM2.5 Cannon.
" Cheap,
unsealed vacuums suck in dust and immediately blast fine particulate matter out of the
exhaust and into the user's face.
Potential UMS (Unique Mechanism of the Solution): H11 HEPA-Grade
Sealed-Gasket Filtration. A laboratory-grade system that ensures what goes in, stays
in, capturing 99.5% of particles as small as 0.3 microns.
The "Guru" & Discovery Story
●
●
Guru: The "Exasperated Detailer.
" Someone who loves "Showroom Quality" but hates
dragging out heavy shop-vacs for a "French Fry Gap" or "Mystery Sludge"
.
Discovery Story: After discovering that his "convenient" mini-vac was actually a
"PM2.5 Cannon" making his allergies worse, our developer turned to Cyclonic Turbine
physics. He realized that by using Polycarbonate build materials and 30 Verified Air
Watts, he could create a "Surgical Strike" tool that fits in a glovebox but performs like a
professional rig.

Belief Chains
1. I believe my current cleaning method (wiping or cheap vacs) is actually making my air
dirtier via "Blowback"
.
2. I believe I need a "Sealed System" to truly protect my family from allergens in the car.
3. I believe "Air Watts"
—not fake "Pa" numbers—are the true measure of a vacuum's
4. 5. power.
I believe a tool that replaces "Canned Air" and inflates pool floats pays for itself.
I believe this is a professional-grade tool, not "e-waste,
" because of its Polycarbonate
build.
